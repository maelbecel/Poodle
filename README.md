## What is it ?
This is the result of the Garrasi project, a second year project. The objective of this project is to create in 5 days a complete Web Application where you can add a comment in every web site, including everything we need to know before create the App, like :
- The Benchmarking
- The Personas
- The Customer Journey
- The Unique Value Proposition
- The Prototype

## Why Poodle ?
We wanted to be different from the other groups, so instead of creating a simple and basic Web App like everyone. We decide to create a unique concept.
Poodle is a website where everyone is angry, if you don't like a website you can't say that here.

## How to use it ?
You can use it only in local. First you need to install the database that you can find [here](https://github.com/maelbecel/Poodle/blob/master/api/database.sql). Then you can clone the repository and run the project like that:

```bash
$> git clone git@github.com:maelbecel/Poodle.git
$> cd Poodle
$> ./runner.sh
```
